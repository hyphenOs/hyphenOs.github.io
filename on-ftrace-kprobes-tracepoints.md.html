    <p>Note: This is going to start more as a brain-dump and over a period of time, I am going to iterate over this, till it comes in some consumable form.</p>
<p>Most of the Linux dynamic tracing is built around the core support in kernel called <code>Ftrace</code>, this started as a function trace sub-system, but is considerably more involved now. All the major tools like <a href="https://lttng.org/">LTTng</a>, <a href="https://sourceware.org/systemtap/">SystemTap</a> or the more recent <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">BCC</a> make use of this infrastructure and then build upon it. In fact some of the kernel developments like <code>kprobes</code> and <code>uprobes</code> were developed in SystemTap project.</p>
<p>Found a <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/images/stories/pdf/lceu2012_zannoni.pdf">good presentation</a>, that provides a historical perspective of how many of these projects are started. I have also created a <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/gabhijit1/clipboards/linux-tracing">clipboard</a>, that give a timeline of Linux tracing and evolution of BPF support. This helped me understand why some of the utilities in <code>bcc</code> won't run on my Ubuntu 16.04 system.</p>
<p>Arguably one of the best (if not the best) resource about Linux tracing is <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/">Brendan Gregg's Blog</a>.</p>
<p>Coming back to specifics - it is possible to 'trace' following -</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A vast majority of kernel functions - those available inside <code>/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/available_filter_functions</code>. (This assumes you have mounted the <code>tracefs</code> in more recent kernels (and <code>debugfs</code> in slightly older kernels) on the <code>/sys/kernel/debug/tracing</code> path. It's possible to trace only a subset of those functions or functions belonging to a particular subsystem like say <code>net</code> etc. Kernel's documentation is a good starting point inside `Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt' and a few other files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>kprobes</code> provided a mechanism to trace both <code>entry</code> and <code>exit</code> of a function. However the mechanism to do this was slightly involved, in the absence of integration with <code>ftrace</code> mechanism (basically a similar mechanism to trace functions above). However with <code>ftrace</code> support for <code>kprobes</code>, this has become very useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition there are a number of <code>tracepoints</code> defined in various subsystems. But it's not quite clear to me - which are the use cases where it would make sense to use this mechanims as opposed to one of the above, which seem to be very flexible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>perf</code> events (not fully understood yet).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Userspace probing (not fully understood it yet).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The recent eBPF has made tracing a lot more interesting. What eBPF essentially allows is adding a code from Userspace to the kernel at the runtime, that can be interfaced with the above <code>ftrace</code> mechanism. <code>bcc</code> pointed above, has developed a lot of useful tools using this mechanism.</p>
<p>I will keep updating this article as we go along.</p>
